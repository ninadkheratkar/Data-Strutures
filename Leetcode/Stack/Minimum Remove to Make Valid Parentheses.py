# 1249. Minimum Remove to Make Valid Parentheses

# Given a string s of '(' , ')' and lowercase English characters.

# Your task is to remove the minimum number of parentheses ( '(' or ')', in any positions ) so that the resulting parentheses string is valid and return any valid string.

# Formally, a parentheses string is valid if and only if:

# It is the empty string, contains only lowercase characters, or
# It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are valid strings, or
# It can be written as (A), where A is a valid string.

            if c == "(":
                stack.append(i)
            elif c == ")":
                if stack:
                    stack.pop()
                else:
                    s[i] = ""
                    
        while stack:
            s[stack.pop()] = ""
